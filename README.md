# Documentation - TaskMaster Lite

This project uses **Doxygen** to generate HTML documentation from Java source code.

## How to Generate Documentation

Make sure you have [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) installed.

Then run the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

## Output

The generated documentation will be located in:

```
docs/html/index.html
```

## Preview the Documentation Locally

You can download the "**Taskmaster-lite-documentation**" in the GitHub Actions in the last workflow (in artifacts),
then unzip it and open the "**index.html**" file (this will open your browser with the Doxygen Documentation).
